# In this task I have to complete the following things:

# 1. Store the initial_guests = ["Bob", "Andrea", "Manuel", "Polly", "Khalid"] guest names in the guests.txt file

# 2. Also store new_guests = ["Sam", "Danielle", "Jacob"] names in the guests.txt file.

# 3. Remove the checked_out=["Andrea", "Manuel", "Khalid"] names from guests.txt file

# Now let's check whether guests_to_check = ['Bob', 'Andrea'] are still checked in.

# Expected result: Bob is checked in, Andrea is not checked in
