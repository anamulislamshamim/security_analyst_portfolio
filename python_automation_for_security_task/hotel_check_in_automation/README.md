**In this task I have to complete the following things:**<br>
* Store the initial_guests = ["Bob", "Andrea", "Manuel", "Polly", "Khalid"] guest names in the guests.txt file*
* Also store new_guests = ["Sam", "Danielle", "Jacob"] names in the guests.txt file.*
* Remove the checked_out=["Andrea", "Manuel", "Khalid"] names from guests.txt file*<br>
Now let's check whether guests_to_check = ['Bob', 'Andrea'] are still checked in.*<br>
Expected result: Bob is checked in, Andrea is not checked in
