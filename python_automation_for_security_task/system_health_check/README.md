# Simple system health check project with python
In this project I used shutil and psutil python libraries <br>

* If free space less than 20% of total space and cpu usages more than 75% then this program will print "Error: system is unhealthy!!! Space should be used less than 80% and cpu usage less than 75%"<br>
* otherwise print system is healthy
