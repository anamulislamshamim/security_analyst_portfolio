In this activity: My social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address the breach, I have to identify some common network hardening tools that can be implemented to protect the organization’s overall security. Then, I will select a specific vulnerability that the company has and propose different network hardening methods. Finally, I will explain how the methods and tools I chose will be effective for managing the vulnerability and how they will prevent potential breaches in the future.<br>

 After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:<br>
 The organization’s employees' share passwords.<br>
 The admin password for the database is set to the default.<br>
 The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.<br>
 Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.
