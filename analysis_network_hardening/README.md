# In this activity: My social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address the breach, I have to identify some common network hardening tools that can be implemented to protect the organizationâ€™s overall security. Then, I will select a specific vulnerability that the company has and propose different network hardening methods. Finally, I will explain how the methods and tools I chose will be effective for managing the vulnerability and how they will prevent potential breaches in the future.
