In this activity, I have to take on the role of a cybersecurity analyst working for a company that hosts the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. Visitors to the website experience a security issue when loading the main webpage. My job is to investigate, identify, document, and recommend a solution to the security problem.<br> 
# 
When investigating the security event, I will review a tcpdump log. I will need to identify the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website. Network protocols are the communication rules and standards networked devices use to transmit data. Unfortunately, malicious actors can also use network protocols to invade and attack private networks. Knowing how to identify the protocols commonly used in attacks will help me protect my organizationâ€™s network against these types of security events
