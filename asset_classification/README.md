I am operating a small business from my home and must create an inventory of my network devices. This will help me determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.<br>
# 
To do this, I will start by identifying three devices that have access to my home network. This might include devices such as:<br>
# 
Desktop or laptop computers <br>
Smartphones <br>
Smart home devices <br>
Game consoles <br>
Storage devices or servers <br>
Video streaming devices <br>
# 
Then, Iâ€™ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, I will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.
