# I am operating a small business from my home and must create an inventory of my network devices. This will help me determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.
# 
# To do this, I will start by identifying three devices that have access to my home network. This might include devices such as:
# 
# Desktop or laptop computers
# Smartphones
# Smart home devices
# Game consoles
# Storage devices or servers
# Video streaming devices
# 
# Then, Iâ€™ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, I will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.
