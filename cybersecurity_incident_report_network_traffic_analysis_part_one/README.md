# **Activity Overview**
# In this activity, you will analyze DNS and ICMP traffic in transit using data from a network protocol analyzer tool. You will identify which network protocol was utilized in assessment of the cybersecurity incident. 
# 
# In the internet layer of the TCP/IP model, the IP formats data packets into IP datagrams. The information provided in the datagram of an IP packet can provide security analysts with insight into suspicious data packets in transit.
# 
# Knowing how to identify potentially malicious traffic on a network can help cybersecurity analysts assess security risks on a network and reinforce network security.
