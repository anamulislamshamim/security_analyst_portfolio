# Conduct a security audit Overview, part 1

# In this part I have to ensure the following things:
# 1. What were the audit scope and goals? 
# 2. What were the critical findings of the audit that need to be addressed immediately (i.e., What controls and/or policies need to be implemented immediately)?
# 3. What are the compliances and laws that the organization's must align with its security posture ? (i.e., PCI/DSS, GDPR, SOC1, SOC2)
