# Conduct a security audit Overview, part 1

**In this part I have to ensure the following things:**
* What were the audit scope and goals? 
* What were the critical findings of the audit that need to be addressed immediately (i.e., What controls and/or policies need to be implemented immediately)?
* What are the compliances and laws that the organization's must align with its security posture ? (i.e., PCI/DSS, GDPR, SOC1, SOC2)
