I recently joined the security team as a level-one security operation center (SOC) analyst at a mid-sized retail company. Along with its physical store locations, my company also conducts operations in e-commerce, which account for 80% of its sales. <br>
# 
I are spending my first week of training becoming familiar with the company's security processes and procedures. Recently, the company experienced a major security incident involving a data breach of over one million users. Because this was a recent and major security incident, my team is working to prevent incidents like this from happening again. This breach happened before I began working at the company. I have been asked to review the final report.<br>
# 
To gain an understanding of the incident's life cycle, my goals for my review are as follows:<br>
Goal 1: Identify exactly what happened.<br>
Goal 2: Identify when it happened. <br>
Goal 3: Identify the response actions that the company took.<br>
Goal 4: Identify future recommendations.
