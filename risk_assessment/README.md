# I've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.
# 
# A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.
# 
# My supervisor asks me to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, I will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, I will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, I will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. I will then compare scores across all risks so my team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
