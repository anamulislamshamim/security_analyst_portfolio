# Conduct a security audit Overview, part 2

**In this part I have to ensure the following things:**

* What were the audit scope and goals? 
* What were the critical findings of the audit that need to be addressed immediately (i.e., What controls and/or policies need to be implemented immediately)?
* What were the findings (i.e., What controls and/or policies that need to be addressed in the future)?
* Summarize your recommendations clearly and concisely to stakeholders?
